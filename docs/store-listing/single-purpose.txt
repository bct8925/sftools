sftools provides developer tools for Salesforce. Users can:

1. Query data using SOQL (with bulk export)
2. Execute anonymous Apex code
3. Make REST API requests
4. Browse object schemas and field metadata
5. View and edit record field values
6. View and stream debug logs in real time
7. Manage trace flags and delete inactive flow versions
8. Subscribe to and publish platform events (optional local proxy required)

The extension authenticates via OAuth 2.0 and communicates directly with Salesforce APIs. No data is sent to third-party services.
