rules:
  tasks:
    - Each task should be independently testable
    - Include affected file paths in task descriptions
    - Break into small units that can be verified individually
    - Include a "Test" task group before the "Verify" group — tests MUST be written using the test-writer agent (Task tool with subagent_type=test-writer)
  design:
    - Reference existing patterns from src/CLAUDE.md
    - Prefer extending existing abstractions over creating new ones
  proposal:
    - Keep under 500 words
    - Include a Non-goals section
